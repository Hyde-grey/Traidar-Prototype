## Implementation Steps

2. Apply changes to the Data resource:
   - Update `amplify/data/resource.ts` with the new version that fixes the function handler path and AI model reference

3. Add the custom signup component:
   - Add `src/components/common/Header/Auth/CustomSignUp.tsx`
   - Update `src/components/common/Header/Auth/Login.tsx` to use the custom signup component

4. Update the UserContext:
   - Update `src/context/UserContext.tsx` to use the nickname attribute as the primary display name

5. Enhance the TraidarAI component:
   - Update `src/components/features/Dashboard/RightPanel/TraidarAi/TraidarAI.tsx` to add the "New Conversation" button

## Testing

After implementing these changes, test the following:

1. Sign up with a nickname
2. Verify the nickname is displayed instead of email
3. Test the "New Conversation" button
4. Verify the AI model is working correctly

## Deployment

After testing locally, deploy the changes:

```bash
amplify push
```

This will update the Auth and Data resources in the cloud.
